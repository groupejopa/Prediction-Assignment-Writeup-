# Prediction-Assignment-Writeup


## Summary
This document is the final report of the Peer Assessment project from the Practical Machine Learning course, which is a part of the Coursera Johnâ€™s Hopkins University Data Science Specialization. It was written and coded in RStudio, using its knitr functions and published in the html and markdown format. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which the six participants performed the exercises. The machine learning algorithm, which uses the classe variable in the training set, is applied to the 20 test cases available in the test data.

## Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

This report describes how a model was built, how cross validation was used, what the expected out of sample error might be, and the rationale behind the choices made. The prediction model will also be used to predict 20 different test cases.
